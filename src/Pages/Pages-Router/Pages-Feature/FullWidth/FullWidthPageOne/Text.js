                    ‘How queer it seems,’ Alice said to herself, ‘to be going messages for a rabbit!
                    I suppose Dinah’ll be sending me on messages next!’ And she began fancying the sort
                    of thing that would happen: ‘”Miss Alice! Come here directly, and get ready for your walk!”
                    “Coming in a minute, nurse! But I’ve got to see that the mouse doesn’t get out.” Only I don’t
                    think,’ Alice went on,
                    ‘that they’d let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people about like that!’

                    By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window,
                    and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she
                    took up the fan and a pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her
                    eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label this
                    time with the words ‘DRINK ME,’ but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips.
                    ‘I know SOMETHING interesting is sure to happen,’ she said to herself, ‘whenever I eat
                    or drink anything; so I’ll just see what this bottle does. I do hope it’ll make me grow large again,
                    for really I’m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!’

                    It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she
                    had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling,
                    and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put down the
                    bottle, saying to herself ‘That’s quite enough—I hope I shan’t grow any more—As it is,
                    I can’t get out at the door—I do wish I hadn’t drunk quite so much!’
