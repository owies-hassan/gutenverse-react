                  For a time he remained in Edgware not knowing what next to do. The flying people
                  increased in number. Many of them, like my brother,
                  seemed inclined to loiter in the place. There was no fresh news of the invaders from Mars.

                      My brother immediately grasped the situation, shouted, and hurried towards the struggle.
                      One of the men desisted and turned towards him, and my brother, realising from his antagonist’s
                      face that a fight was unavoidable,
                      and being an expert boxer, went into him forthwith and sent him down against the wheel of the chaise.

                  Partly stunned, he found himself facing the man who had held the horse’s
                  head, and became aware of the chaise receding from him down the lane, swaying
                  from side to side, and with the women in it looking back. The man before him,
                  a burly rough, tried to close, and he stopped him with a blow in the face.
                  Then, realising that he was deserted, he dodged round and made off down the
                  lane after the chaise, with the sturdy
                  man close behind him, and the fugitive, who had turned now, following remotely.

                      It was no time for pugilistic chivalry and my brother laid him quiet with a kick,
                      and gripped the collar of the man who pulled at the slender lady’s arm. He heard the
                      clatter of hoofs, the whip stung across his face, a third antagonist struck him between
                      the eyes, and the man he held
                      wrenched himself free and made off down the lane in the direction from which he had come.
