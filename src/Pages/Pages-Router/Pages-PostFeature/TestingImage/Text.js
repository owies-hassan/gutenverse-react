                   Another bank drove over Ealing, and surrounded a little island of survivors on
                   Castle Hill, alive, but unable to escape. So he got out of the fury of the panic,
                   and, skirting<NavLink className='hover-link text-decoration' to='/'> the Edgware Road</NavLink>,
                   reached Edgware about seven, fasting and wearied, but well ahead of the crowd.

                       And as the day advanced and the engine drivers and stokers refused to return to London,
                       the pressure of the flight drove the people in an ever-thickening multitude away from
                       the stations and along the northward-running roads. By midday a Martian had been seen at Barnes,
                       and a cloud of slowly sinking black vapour drove along the Thames and across the flats of
                       Lambeth, cutting off all escape over the bridges in its sluggish advance.<br/><br/>

                       It was perhaps a vague idea of making his way to Chelmsford, where some friends of
                       his lived, that at last induced my brother to strike into a quiet lane running eastward.
                       Presently he came upon a stile, and, crossing it, followed a footpath northeastward. He passed near several
                       farmhouses and some little places whose names he did not learn.

                       A mile from Edgware the rim of the wheel broke, and the
                       machine became unridable.

                   He heard their screams, and, hurrying round the corner, saw a couple of men struggling to drag
                   them out of the little pony-chaise in which they had been driving, while a third with difficulty
                   held the frightened ponyâ€™s head. One of the ladies, a short woman dressed in white, was simply
                   screaming; the other, a dark, slender figure,
                   slashed at the man who gripped her arm with a whip she held in her disengaged hand.
