                          Ere this, you must have plainly seen the truth of what I started with—that
                          the Sperm Whale and the Right Whale have almost entirely different heads
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          To sum up, then: in the Right Whale’s there is no great well of sperm; no
                          ivory teeth at all; no long, slender mandible of a lower jaw, like the Sperm Whale’s
                      </li>
                      <li >
                          Nor in the Sperm Whale are there any of those blinds of
                          bone; no huge lower lip; and scarcely anything of a tongue
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          Again, the Right Whale has two external spout-holes, the Sperm Whale only one
                      </li>
                      <li>Look your last, now, on these venerable hooded heads, while they yet lie together; for one will soon sink,
                          unrecorded, in the sea; the other will not be very long in following</li>
                      <li>
                          Can you catch the expression of the Sperm Whale’s there? It is the same he died with,
                          only some of the longer wrinkles in the forehead seem now faded away
                      </li>
                      <li>I think his broad brow to be full of a prairie-like placidity, born of a speculative indifference as to death</li>
                      <li>But mark the other head’s expression</li>
                      <li>See that amazing lower lip, pressed by accident against the vessel’s side, so as firmly to embrace the jaw</li>
                  </ul>

                   I believe I have broken a finger here against his cursed jaw ain’t those mincing knives
                   down in the forecastle there, men? look to those handspikes, my hearties. Captain,
                   by God, look to yourself say the word don’t be a fool; forget it all;
                   we are ready to turn to treat us decently, and we’re your men; but we won’t be flogged.

                      We can’t possibly stay here, I said; and as I spoke the firing reopened for a moment upon
                      the common. “But where are we to go?” said my wife in terror. I thought perplexed.
                      Then I remembered her cousins at<strong>Leatherhead?.</strong><br/><br/>

                      Leatherhead! I shouted above the sudden noise. She looked away
                      from me downhill. The people were coming out of their houses, astonished.
                      “How are we to get to Leatherhead ” she said.

                  and I started off at once for the Spotted Dog, for I knew the landlord had a
