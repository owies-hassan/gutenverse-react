            and here he is, just from the surgeon. But at that moment he chanced to turn his face so towards the light,
            that I plainly saw they could not be sticking-plasters at all, those black squares on his cheeks.
            <strong> They were stains of some sort or other</strong>. At first I knew not what to make of this; but soon an
            inkling of the truth occurred to me. I remembered a story of
            a white man—a whaleman too—who, falling among the cannibals, had been tattooed by them.

                    I concluded that this harpooneer, in the course of his distant voyages,
                    must have met with a similar adventure. And what is it, thought I, after all!

                    It’s only his outside; a man can be honest in any sort of skin. But then, what to make of
                    his unearthly complexion, that part of it,
                    I mean, lying round about, and completely independent of the squares of tattooing.

                To be sure, it might be nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning; but
                I never heard of a hot sun’s tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one. However,
                I had never been in the South Seas; and perhaps the sun there produced these extraordinary
                effects upon the skin. Now, while all these ideas were passing through me like lightning,
                this harpooneer never noticed me at all. But, after some difficulty having opened his bag,
                he commenced fumbling in it,
                and presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk, and a seal-skin wallet with the hair on.
