                Likewise, there was a parcel of outlandish bone fish hooks on
                the shelf over the fire-place, and a tall harpoon standing at
                the head of the bed. Placing these on the<NavLink className='hover-link text-decoration' to='/'> old chest</NavLink> in the middle of the room,
                he then took the New Zealand head—a ghastly thing enough—and crammed it down into the bag.

                    To be sure, it might be nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning; but I never heard
                    of a hot sun’s tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one. However, I had never been
                    in the South Seas; and perhaps the sun there produced these extraordinary effects upon the skin.<br/><br/>

                    Now, while all these ideas were passing through me like lightning, this harpooneer never
                    noticed me at all. But, after some difficulty having opened his bag, he commenced fumbling
                    in it, and presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk, and a seal-skin wallet with the hair on.<br/><br/>

                    <strong> He now took off his hat—a new beaver hat—when I came nigh singing out with fresh surprise</strong>.
                    There was no hair on his head—none to speak of at least—nothing but a small scalp-knot twisted
                    up on his forehead. His bald purplish head now looked for all the world like a mildewed skull.
                    Had not the stranger stood
                    between me and the door, I would have bolted out of it quicker than ever I bolted a dinner.
