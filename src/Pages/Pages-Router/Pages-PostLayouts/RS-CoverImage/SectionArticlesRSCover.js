                Through two long weeks I wandered, stumbling through the nights guided only by the stars and hiding during the
                days behind some protruding rock or among the occasional hills I traversed.
                For two days I waited there for Kantos Kan, but as he did not come I started off on foot in a
                northwesterly direction toward a point where he had told me lay the nearest waterway.
