                What manner of thing was upon me I did not know, but that it was large and heavy and many-legged
                I could feel. My hands were at its throat before the fangs had a chance to bury themselves in my neck,
                and slowly I forced the hairy face from me and closed my fingers, vise-like, upon its windpipe.

                        uncouth monstrosities that leaped upon me in the dark,
                        so that I had ever to grasp my long-sword in my hand that I might be ready for them.</li>
                    <li>Usually my strange, newly acquired telepathic power warned me in ample time,
                        but once I was down with vicious fangs at my jugular and a

                    The nearer moon, hurtling suddenly above the horizon and lighting up the Barsoomian scene,
                    showed me that my preserver was Woola, but from whence he had come, or how found me,
                    I was at a loss to know. That I was glad of his companionship it is needless to say,
                    but my pleasure at seeing him was tempered by anxiety as to the reason of his leaving Dejah Thoris.
                    Only her death I felt sure,
                    could account for his absence from her, so faithful I knew him to be to my commands.

                    2-I straining to maintain my grip and choke the life from it as I kept it from my throat.<br/>
                    3-Slowly my arms gave to the unequal struggle, and inch by inch the burning eyes and gleaming tusks of my antagonist crept toward me, until, as the hairy face touched mine again,<br/>
                    4-I realized that all was over. And then a living mass of destruction sprang from the surrounding darkness full upon the creature that held me pinioned to the ground.<br/>
                    5-The two rolled growling upon the moss, tearing and rending one another in a frightful manner, but it was soon over and my preserver stood with lowered head above the throat of the dead thing which would have killed me.<br/>

                    I could find no bell or other method of making my presence known to the inmates of the place,
                    unless a small round role in the wall near the door was for that purpose.
                    It was of about the bigness of a lead pencil and thinking that it
                    might be in the nature of a speaking tube I put my mouth to it and
                    was about to call into it when a voice issued from it
                    asking me whom I might be, where from, and the nature of my errand.
