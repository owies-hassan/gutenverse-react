                and as he turned from my caress and commenced greedily to devour the dead carcass at my feet
                I realized that the poor fellow was more than half starved. I, myself, was in but little
                better plight but I could not bring myself to eat
                the uncooked flesh and I had no means of making a fire. When Woola had finished his meal I
                again took up my weary and seemingly endless wandering in quest of the elusive waterway.<br/><br/>

                At daybreak of the fifteenth day of my search I was overjoyed to see the high trees that denoted
                the object of my search. About noon I dragged myself wearily to the portals of a huge building
                which covered perhaps four square miles and towered two hundred feet in the air.
                It showed no aperture in the mighty walls other than the tiny door at which I sank
                exhausted, nor was there any sign of life about it.
