              While now the fated Pequod had been so long afloat this voyage, the log and line
              had but very seldom been in use. Owing to a confident reliance upon other means of
              determining the vessel’s place, some merchantmen, and many whalemen, especially when
              cruising, wholly neglect to heave the log; though at the same time, and frequently
              more for form’s sake than anything else, regularly putting down upon the customary
              slate the course steered by the ship, as well as the presumed average rate of progression
              every hour. It had been thus with the Pequod. The wooden reel and angular
              log attached hung, long untouched, just beneath the railing of the after bulwarks.
