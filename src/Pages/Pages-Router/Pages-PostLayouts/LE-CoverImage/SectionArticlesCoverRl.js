                A moderate incline runs towards the foot of Maybury Hill, and down this we clattered. Once the
                lightning had begun, it went on in as rapid a succession of flashes as I have ever seen.<br/><br/>

                At first I regarded little but the road before me, and then abruptly my attention was arrested
                by something that was moving rapidly down the opposite slope of Maybury Hill. At first I took it
                for the wet roof of a house, but one flash following another showed it to be in swift rolling movement.
