                My wife was curiously silent throughout the drive, and seemed oppressed with forebodings of
                evil. I talked to her reassuringly,
                pointing out that the Martians were tied to the Pit by sheer heaviness, and at
                the utmost could but crawl a little out of it; but she answered only in monosyllables.
                Had it not been for my promise to the innkeeper, she would, I think, have
                urged me to stay in Leatherhead that night. Would that I had! Her face,
                I remember, was very white as we parted.
                <br/><br/>
                For my own part, I had been feverishly excited all day. Something very
                like the war fever that occasionally runs through a civilised community
                had got into my blood, and in my heart I was not so very sorry that I
                had to return to Maybury that night. I was even afraid that that last
                fusillade I had heard might mean the extermination of our invaders from Mars.
                I can best express my state of mind by saying that I wanted to be in at the death.
                <br/><br/>
                Close on its apparition, and blindingly violet by contrast,
                danced out the first lightning of the gathering storm, and the thunder burst
                like a rocket overhead. The horse took the bit between his teeth and bolted.
