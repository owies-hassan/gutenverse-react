              After many similar hair-breadth escapes, we at last swiftly glided into what
              had just been one of the outer circles, but now crossed by random whales, all
              violently making for one centre. This lucky salvation was cheaply purchased by
              the loss of <NavLink className='hover-link text-decoration' to='/'>Queequegâ€™s hat</NavLink>, who, while standing in the bows to prick the
              fugitive whales, had his hat taken
              clean from his head by the air-eddy made by the sudden tossing of a pair of broad flukes close by.
