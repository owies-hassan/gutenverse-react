                By the light of the now brilliant moons I saw that he was but a shadow of his
                former self, and as he turned from my caress and commenced greedily to devour
                the dead carcass at my feet I realized that the poor fellow was more than half starved.
                I, myself, was in but little better plight but I could not bring myself to eat the uncooked
                flesh and I had no means of making a fire. When Woola had finished his meal I
                again took up my weary and seemingly endless wandering in quest of the elusive waterway.

                When the amphitheater had cleared I crept stealthily to the
                top and as the great excavation lay far from the plaza and in an untenanted portion of
                the great dead city I had little trouble in reaching the hills beyond.<br/>

                For two days I waited there for Kantos Kan, but as he did not come I started off on foot in a
                northwesterly direction toward a point where he had told me lay the nearest waterway.
                My only food consisted of
                vegetable milk from the plants which gave so bounteously of this priceless fluid.

                        Several times I was attacked by wild beasts; strange, uncouth monstrosities that leaped upon me
                        in the dark, so that I had ever

                        hairy face pressed close to mine before I knew that I was even threatened.

                    Through two long weeks I wandered, stumbling through the nights guided only by the stars
                    and hiding during the days behind some protruding rock or among the occasional hills I
                    traversed. Several times I was attacked by wild beasts; strange, uncouth monstrosities
