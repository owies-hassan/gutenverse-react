                The nearer moon, hurtling suddenly above the horizon and lighting up the Barsoomian scene,
                showed me that my preserver was Woola, but from whence he had come, or how found me,
                I was at a loss to know. That I was glad of his companionship it is needless to say,
                but my pleasure at seeing him was tempered by anxiety as to the reason of his leaving Dejah Thoris.
                Only her death I felt sure, could account for his absence from her, so faithful I knew him to be to my commands.
