                By the light of the now brilliant moons I saw that he was but a shadow of his former self,
                and as he turned from my caress and commenced greedily to devour the dead carcass at my feet
                I realized that the poor fellow was more than half starved. I, myself, was in but little better
                plight but I could not bring myself to eat the uncooked flesh and I had no means of making a fire.

                For two days I waited there for Kantos Kan, but as he did not come I started off on
                foot in a northwesterly direction toward a point where he had told me lay the nearest waterway.
                My only food consisted of vegetable milk from the plants which gave so bounteously of this priceless fluid.

                What manner of thing was upon me I did not know, but that it was large and heavy and many-legged I
                could feel. My hands were at its throat before the fangs had a chance to bury themselves in my neck,
                and slowly I forced the hairy face from me and closed my fingers, vise-like, upon its windpipe.

                    <li>Several times I was attacked by wild beasts; strange,
                        uncouth monstrosities that leaped upon me in the dark,

                    <li>Usually my strange, newly acquired telepathic power warned me in ample time,

                    2-I straining to maintain my grip and choke the life from it as I kept it from my throat.<br/>
                    3-Slowly my arms gave to the unequal struggle, and inch by inch the burning eyes and gleaming tusks of my antagonist crept toward me, until, as the hairy face touched mine again,<br/>
                    4-I realized that all was over. And then a living mass of destruction sprang from the surrounding darkness full upon the creature that held me pinioned to the ground.<br/>
                    5-The two rolled growling upon the moss, tearing and rending one another in a frightful manner, but it was soon over and my preserver stood with lowered head above the throat of the dead thing which would have killed me.<br/>
